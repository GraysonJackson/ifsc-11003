    <h4>From the soccer fields to the cybersecurity labs — a tale of grit, growth, and the occasional minivan tune-up. </h4>
    <section class="main">
        <p>
            Carter’s legend began at Little Rock Central High, where he played soccer and learned the art of focus, teamwork, and never backing down from a challenge. Those early days forged the competitive streak that now fuels his relentless drive to outsmart ransomware, outcode malware, and outplay everyone in CSGO.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now at UA Little Rock, Carter has risen to academic stardom as a Donaghey Scholar — a title reserved for only the most dedicated and brilliant students. He’s currently conducting ransomware research, exploring how cybercriminals operate and how to stop them in their digital tracks. Somewhere between reverse-engineering malware and writing flawless code, he still finds time to crack jokes and hit the gym like it’s a boss battle.
        </p>
        <p>
            He’s been named to both the Dean’s List and Chancellor’s List, because apparently excellence isn’t optional for Carter — it’s just his default setting.
