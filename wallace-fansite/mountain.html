        <img src="assets/lion.jpg" alt="Carter Wallace sticking his finger in his mouth" />
        <h4>All hail the dual-wielding cybersecurity scholar and minivan mogul himself. </h4>
    </header>
    <section class="main">
        <p>
            When Carter isn’t fighting ransomware, he’s fighting his <em>CSGO</em> opponents — and trust me, they lose often. Known online as “Mountain”, he’s the kind of gamer who strategizes like a grandmaster and trash-talks like a stand-up comedian. <em>Skyrim?</em> He’s modded it into oblivion. <em>CSGO</em>? He’s the reason your K/D ratio cries at night.
        </p>
        <p>
            But Carter’s not all firewalls and frags — he’s got <strong>motion</strong>. He hikes Arkansas trails, listens to <em>The Decemberists</em>, and maintains <em>The Swagger Wagon</em> with the kind of devotion most people reserve for pets. Rumor has it the Wagon runs on good vibes and Bluetooth playlists.
        </p>
        <p>
            Carter is equal parts tech genius, fitness enthusiast, and chaotic good energy. He’s the kind of guy who’ll explain cryptography to you mid-workout and somehow make it sound fun.
        </p>
