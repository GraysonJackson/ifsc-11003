        <h4>All hail the dual-wielding cybersecurity scholar and minivan mogul himself. </h4>

    <section class="main">
        <p>
            When Carter isn’t fighting ransomware, he’s fighting his CSGO opponents — and trust me, they lose often. Known online as “Mountain”, he’s the kind of gamer who strategizes like a grandmaster and trash-talks like a stand-up comedian. Skyrim? He’s modded it into oblivion. CSGO? He’s the reason your K/D ratio cries at night.
        </p>
        <p>
            But Carter’s not all firewalls and frags — he’s got range. He hikes Arkansas trails, listens to The Decemberists, and maintains The Swagger Wagon with the kind of devotion most people reserve for pets. Rumor has it the Wagon runs on good vibes and Bluetooth playlists.
        </p>
        <p>
            Carter is equal parts tech genius, fitness enthusiast, and chaotic good energy. He’s the kind of guy who’ll explain cryptography to you mid-workout and somehow make it sound fun.
