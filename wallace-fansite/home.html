                Carter Wallace is what happens when discipline meets chaos and decides to double major. As a Cybersecurity and Computer Science student at UA Little Rock, Carter spends his days locking down digital fortresses and his nights destroying enemies in <em>CSGO</em>. He's a Donaghey Scholar, a ransomware researcher, and the proud owner of <em>The Swagger Wagon</em> — a vintage Toyota minivan that's more iconic than any celebrity car could ever dream to be.
            </p>
            <p>
                While others rely on caffeine, Carter powers himself with pure protein and unshakable determination. You'll find him sipping a protein shake like it's fine wine, probably explaining why two-factor authentication is the key to civilization's survival.
            </p>
            <p>
                But don't let his academic accolades fool you — Carter's also the life of the party. He's energetic, hilarious, and has never once been spotted without at least one witty comment locked and loaded. Carter isn't just a student — he's an experience.

            <li>Once ran on nothing but protein and spite during finals week.</li>
            <li>Refuses to drink caffeine. Like, morally.</li>
            <li>Uses the gamertag “Mountain” — a name that symbolizes both his gaming dominance and his peak-level chill (except during <em>CSGO</em> ranked matches).</li>
            <li>Former YouTube sensation (a.k.a. iMountain), known to at least seven loyal fans and one confused algorithm.</li>
