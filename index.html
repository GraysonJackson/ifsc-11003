    <h1>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h1>
    <p>
        Progressive enhancement is a content first approach to web design that emphasizes core webpage content first. The idea is to build a basic, functional webpage using simple HTML that works on all browsers and devices, then layer on more advanced features and styles using CSS and JavaScript for browsers that support them. This ensures that all users can access the essential content and functionality of the site, regardless of their browser capabilities or device limitations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Progressive enhancement is important in modern web development because it prioritizes accessibility, usability, and performance. By ensuring that the core content is available to all users, developers can create inclusive experiences. Additionally, progressive enhancement helps improve page load times and overall performance by allowing browsers to only load the necessary resources based on their capabilities. This approach also future-proofs websites, as new technologies and features can be added without breaking the existing functionality for users on older browsers.

         Carter Wallace Fansite Reflection
    </h1>
    <p>
        In creating the Carter Wallace Fansite, I believe I did well in structuring the HTML to ensure semantic correctness and accessibility. I used appropriate tags for headings, paragraphs, lists, and navigation, which helps both users and search engines understand the content hierarchy. Additionally, I incorporated external links and a mailto link in the footer, enhancing user interaction options. The inclusion of meta tags for description and author also adds to the professionalism of the site.
        <br><br>
        If I were to start over, I would focus more on enhancing the visual design and user experience. While the structure is solid, I think there is room for improvement in terms of aesthetics, such as using more engaging images, better typography choices, and a more varied but still cohesive color scheme. Additionally, I would consider adding interactive elements or animations to make the site more dynamic and engaging for visitors.
        <br><br>
        Regarding feedback, I received suggestions to improve the responsiveness of the site for different screen sizes. To address this, I implemented media queries in the CSS to ensure that the layout adapts well on mobile devices and tablets. However, I chose not to add complex JavaScript functionalities beyond the photo slides to maintain simplicity and focus on core content delivery, aligning with progressive enhancement principles.
